# Home_Credit_Default_Risk_Project
Repository for a predictive modeling project aimed at improving loan approvals for individuals with minimal credit history. Utilizes logistic regression and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to predict loan repayment probabilities, enhancing financial inclusion efforts.
## Business Problem Statement
Home Credit, a global financial institution, is dedicated to expanding financial access to customers who often find themselves excluded from the conventional banking system due to their insufficient credit histories. This demographic represents a significant portion of the global market, yet poses a unique challenge: assessing their creditworthiness accurately without traditional credit data, which increases the risk of defaults. High default rates can have serious repercussions, not only affecting the company's financial health but also its mission to foster financial inclusion responsibly.

This project addresses this critical challenge by developing an advanced predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques. Leveraging a combination of traditional credit data and alternative data sources, such as telecommunications and transaction histories, the model aims to enhance the accuracy of predicting loan repayment probabilities. By improving how creditworthiness is assessed, Home Credit hopes to achieve a dual objective: extending more credit opportunities to those who are typically overlooked while managing risk more effectively. This balance is crucial for promoting financial inclusion without compromising on lending standards and ensuring that loans are both accessible and sustainable.

The insights and tools generated from this project are intended to guide Home Credit in making informed lending decisions that support the financial empowerment of a broader customer base, aligning with ethical lending practices and the company's strategic goals
